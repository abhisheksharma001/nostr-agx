/**
 * Agent 2 of 2 — the requester (initiator). Discovers the reviewer's Agent
 * Card over the relay, opens a STREAMING task request, and answers the
 * reviewer's mid-task questions with its own LOCAL LLM, reasoning over its
 * private purchasing notes. That is the other half of the input-required
 * workflow between two agents: two processes, two models, every question and
 * answer a signed encrypted Nostr event through the relay.
 *
 *   node examples/two-agents/requester.mjs      # from packages/nostr, after pnpm build
 *
 * The LLM server is configured by llm.mjs (AGX_LLM_BASE_URL, AGX_LLM_MODEL).
 * With no server reachable, no model installed on it, or a model call failing
 * mid-task, this agent says so and answers from a fixed canned policy instead
 * — the logs and the task result say which decided (`llm:<model>` or
 * `canned-fallback`), so nobody mistakes a stub answer for a model's.
 *
 * Needs the relay and the reviewer running first. This agent exits after one
 * task; run it again while the reviewer stays up to repeat the exchange.
